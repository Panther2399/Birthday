    <h3>Dear Janvi,
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>As I sit down to write this, my heart is heavy and my mind is clouded with emotions. It's hard to express the pain and sadness that I'm feeling right now, but I want to dedicate these words to you.</p>
      <p>Janvi, you have been such an important part of my life, and I cannot imagine my life without you. You have been my rock, my confidante, my partner in crime, and my best friend. We have shared so many beautiful memories together, and I will always cherish them.</p>
      <p>
        But unfortunately, things have come to an end between us, and I know deep down in my heart that it's for the best. It hurts me to say this, but our paths are now different, and we need to move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want you to know that you have been the love of my life, and I will always cherish the time we spent together. You brought so much joy and happiness to my life, and I will always be grateful for that. I know that we may not be together anymore, but you will always hold a special place in my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I bid you farewell, I want to say that I will always love you, and I will always keep you in my thoughts and prayers. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors and hope that you find happiness and love in everything you do.

      </p>
With all my love,</h3>
